# VisualDefectDetection
This project uses a raspberry pi 5 to perform assembly line monitoring, statistics collection and recording. This includes drawing bounding boxes to highlight misaligned components during assembly, counting the number of detected errors, collecting statistics on assembled devices, using a second station to determine tardiness on the assembly line.
